#####OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING SYSTEM#######
---->DEFNITION
     *Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a fundamental concept in Java that every developer must understand.
      It allows developers to structure code using classes and objects, making it more modular, reusable, and scalable.
     * It is a programming approach that organizes code into objects and classes and makes it more structured and easy to manage. 
----->Concepts
      *Class
      *object
      *Abstraction
      *Encapsulation
      *Polymorphism
      *Inheritance
      *Constructur
      *Interface
      *Access Modifier
------>Class<------
WHAT?
  *A class in Java is like a blueprint or a design plan.
It is not real, but it defines:
>What kind of data an object will have (variables)
>What kind of actions it can perform (methods)
>It does not use real memory until you create an object from it.
WHY?
 >To avoid repeating the same code for multiple things
 >To keep related data and behavior together
 >To make code more organized, reusable, and easy to manage

HOW?
  // This is a class named Car
class Car {
    // Data (called fields or variables)
    String color;
    int speed;

    // Behavior (called methods)
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("The car is driving.");
    }

    void stop() {
        System.out.println("The car has stopped.");
    }
}
