###Java Data Types
  >>>Defnition
     Java is statically typed and also a strongly typed language because each type of data
     , such as integer, character, hexadecimal, packed decimal etc.is predefined as part of the programming language,
     and all constants or variables defined for a given program must be declared with the specific data types

 >>>Why Data Types Matter in Java?      
       *Memory Efficiency
       *Performance
       *Code Clarity
       
  >>>Java Data Type Categories
       java has two categories in which data types are segregated
      1. Primitive Data Type:
          --> these are the simple values that can be stored directly into the variable or memory.
          -->Example:
                   *boolean,int,char,short,double,float,byte.

      2. Non-Primitive Data Types (Object Types):
          -->These are reference types that store memory addresses of objects.
          -->Example:String,Array,Class,interface,object


#####WORKING FLOW OF THE BOTH THE DATATYPES####

  *The values will be stored in the two different memories:
            --->Stack memory
            --->Heap memory

  --->PRIMITIVE STYLE
    *The variables and values will be stored in the same memory location called the stack memory
    *This are small in size can be stored directly in the Stack memory
    *This values are easy to acess and proces as well

 ---->NON-PRIMITIVE STYLE
    *The actual value of the variable are stored in  the heap memory 
    *The variable contains the memory Address of the actual stored in the memory
    *The values are stored in the heap memory because the values are large in size
    *The Stack only contains the reference variable and address
